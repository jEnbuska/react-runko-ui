## Why React Runko UI?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Atomic Components" icon="puzzle">
    Pure HTML element wrappers (Input, Label, Button, Select, etc.) without layout opinions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Easy to Override" icon="pencil">
    Styles use :where() selector for zero specificity, making overrides trivial
  </Card>
  <Card title="Composable" icon="blocks">
    Build your own layouts and patterns by composing atomic elements
  </Card>
  <Card title="Lightweight" icon="rocket">
    Minimal dependencies - only React as a peer dependency
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Philosophy

React Runko UI provides atomic, unstyled React components with optional minimal CSS. Layout is intentionally left to the developer, allowing maximum flexibility in how you structure your application.

The library uses the `:where()` CSS pseudo-class for styling, which has zero specificity. This means you can easily override any style with your own CSS without fighting specificity battles.

## Quick Example

```jsx
import { Input, Label, Button } from 'react-runko-ui';
import 'react-runko-ui/dist/styles.css';

function LoginForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <div>
        <Label htmlFor="email" required>Email</Label>
        <Input 
          id="email" 
          type="email" 
          placeholder="your@email.com" 
        />
      </div>
      <Button variant="primary" type="submit">
        Sign In
      </Button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

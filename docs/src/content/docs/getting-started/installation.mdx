---

## Installation

Install React Runko UI using your preferred package manager:

### npm

```bash
npm install react-runko-ui
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn add react-runko-ui
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm add react-runko-ui
```

## Peer Dependencies

React Runko UI requires React 16.8 or higher:

```json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": ">=16.8.0",
    "react-dom": ">=16.8.0"
  }
}
```

## Importing Styles

To use the default styles, import the CSS file in your application:

```jsx
import 'react-runko-ui/dist/styles.css';
```

You can import this in your main application file (e.g., `App.tsx` or `index.tsx`).

:::tip
The styles use `:where()` selectors with zero specificity, so you can easily override them with your own CSS without needing `!important`.
:::

## TypeScript

React Runko UI is written in TypeScript and includes full type definitions out of the box. No additional setup is needed for TypeScript projects.
